# Resume Setup

To add your resume to the portfolio:

1. **Add your PDF file** to this `public` folder
2. **Name it exactly:** `resume.pdf` 
3. **Recommended PDF size:** Keep it under 2MB for faster loading
4. **Ensure it's web-optimized** for better performance

## File Location
```
public/
├── README-RESUME.md (this file)
└── resume.pdf (your resume - ADD THIS FILE)
```

## Tips for Better Performance
- Use a PDF optimizer before adding your resume
- Keep file size reasonable (under 2MB recommended)
- Ensure the PDF is not password protected
- Test that it opens properly in browsers

Once you add `resume.pdf` to this folder, the resume viewer in your portfolio will work perfectly!
